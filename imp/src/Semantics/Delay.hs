module Semantics.Delay where

-- | The Delay data type allows us to handle delayed computations, which are
-- computations that *may* happen in the future but do not have to. This type
-- allows us to implement partial functions from a to b as functions a -> Delay b.
-- Elements of the form Now a can be thought of as *finished* computations that have
-- a as result. Computations that finish after n steps with result a are of the form
-- Delay^n (Now a). Finally, non-terminationg computations are of the shape bot, see below.
